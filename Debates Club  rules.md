## Guide on debates

### Structure

The basic formula for writing a debate is:

- to be given an opening line,
- to state and define your topic,
- to signpost your arguments,
- to rebut opposing viewpoints,
- to give your own arguments,
- and then round things off with a nice, simple conclusion.

### Dos and Don'ts for Debating

- Do make eye contact and speak loudly and clearly.
- Don't read directly from your notes.
- Do use conviction in your speech; this will increase engagement.
- Don't disagree with facts or things that are obviously true.
- Do pause between arguments to add emphasis.
- Don't use many filler words.
- Do have a relaxed posture and demeanour.
- Don't personally attack a speaker rather than their idea. This is an ad hominem argument. Avoid these and other logical fallacies when debating.

### Logical falacies

_Logical fallacies_ are errors in reasoning that undermine the strength and logic of your argument, often because they lack evidence to support their claim. Avoid these common logical fallacies, and be prepared to spot them in your opponents' arguments.

- CIRCULAR REASONING  
    In circular reasoning, the reasoner begins and ends with the same argument.  
      
    _Example: "A is true because B is true: B is true because A is true."_
- SLIPPERY SLOPE  
    In aslippery slope argument, the reasoner asserts that one small step will lead to a chain of related events, resulting in an unintended consequence.  
      
    _Example: "If you eat a cookie, then you'll eat 10 cookies -next thing you know, you'll have gained 20 pounds."_
- EITHER/OR REASONING In the either/or fallacy, also known as false dilemma, the reasoner asserts that there are only two possible outcomes, intentionally or unintentionally ignoring other possibilities.  
      
    _Example: "America: love it or leave it."_
- AD HOMINEM Ad hominem arguments are personal attacks against a person rather than an argument against the position they are taking.  
      
    _Example: "You don't understand my argument because you are a woman."_
- ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM This fallacious argument is based on the premise that since many people believe something to be true, it must be true.  
      
    _Example: "Most people believe Earth is at the center of the universe; therefore, it must be true."_
- BEGGING THE QUESTION  
    When begging the question, the reasoner's arguments assume the truth of the conclusion rather than support its veracity.  
      
    _Example: "God exists because it says so in the Bible. And the Bible contains the word of God."_
- HASTY GENERALIZATION In a hasty generalization, the conclusion the reasoner is supporting is justified by insufficient evidence.  
      
    _Example: "My grandma smoked two packs a day for 30 years, so cigarettes can't be that bad for you."_
- STRAW MAN In a straw man argument, the reasoner exaggerates or misrepresents their opponent's argument to an extreme, then attacks the distorted argument.  
      
    _Example: Senator Aclaims we should reconsider how much funding goes to the millitary. Senator Bsays Senator A wants the nation to be defenseless._
